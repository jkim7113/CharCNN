<h1>Word Difficulty Prediction using charCNN</h1>
<p>A Character-level CNN regression model inspired by A. Basu, A. Garain, and S. K. Naskar, "Word Difficulty Prediction Using Convolutional Neural Networks."</p>
<p>Original implementation of the classification model can be found <a href="https://github.com/garain/Word-Difficulty-Prediction/blob/master/README.md">here</a> along with the research paper.</p>
